# [QUESTION 1] SHAPES
#
# Create a menu system allowing the user to draw shapes, with the ability to quit the program when needed.
# The menu should look like this (Don’t include the parts in blue). The triangle menus should ask the user what SIZE
# the shape should be.
#
# Main Menu
# 1 - Draw a Triangle This leads to
# another menu (triangle menu)
# Q - Quit
#
# Triangle Menu
# 1 – Right sided triangle
# 2 – Isosceles triangle
# Q – Back Go back to the main
# menu
#
# Errors should be prevented when possible – such as entering a menu choice that doesn’t exist, entering a letter
# instead of a number (for size), and importantly for a isosceles triangle you must enter a number that’s ODD and
# greater than 0. Eg: You cannot draw a perfect isosceles triangle with a size of 4.
