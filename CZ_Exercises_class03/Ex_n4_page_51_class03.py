# print 10 random values of numbers between 1 and 100.
# The random.randint function takes two arguments: the start and the end of the range for the generated integer values.

# Exercise - 4: Guessing Numbers
# Write a program that choose an integer between 0 and 100, inclusive. The
# program prompts the user to enter a number continuously until the number
# matches the chosen number. For each user input, the program tells the user
# whether the input is too low or too high, so the user can choose the next
# input intelligently.
# After the user guess correctly, the program will print: â€œBravo you guess
# correctly after ... times

# initialize variables
