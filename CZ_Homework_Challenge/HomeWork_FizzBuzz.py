# Homework Challenge: FizzBuzz
# Print a list of numbers from 0 to 25, including 25.
# If the number is divisible by 3, print the number and "Fizz".
# If the number is divisible by 5, print the number and "Buzz".
# If the number is divisible by both, print the number and "FizzBuzzâ€œ
# If the number is divisible by neither, print just the number.
# Separate the number and "FizzBuzz" by a TAB character.
# Note, this is a commonly asked question at job interviews.
# The goal, rather than just making it work, is to try to write it as clearly and efficiently as possible.
